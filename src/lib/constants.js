    text: `A hungry Fox came upon a vineyard where clusters of ripe grapes hung from a tall trellis.

"Those grapes look absolutely delicious," he said to himself. He backed up and took a running leap, snapping at the nearest bunch, but missed.

He tried again and again, jumping higher each time, but the grapes were always just out of reach.

Finally, exhausted and frustrated, the Fox turned away. "Those grapes are probably sour anyway," he muttered as he walked off. "Who wants sour grapes?"

And so it is with many people. What they cannot have, they pretend to despise.`,

    text: `The city had been empty for years. Rain fell on cracked pavement, weeds grew through the sidewalks, and silence filled every room.

Except for Unit Seven.

"Good morning," it said to no one, as it had every day for three thousand, two hundred and fourteen days. It swept the lobby floor, arranged the wilted flowers, and checked the mailbox.

"No mail today," Unit Seven reported. It paused by the window. "The clouds look lovely."

A bird landed on the windowsill. Unit Seven tilted its head. "Hello," it said. "Would you like to come inside? I could make tea."

The bird chirped once and flew away. Unit Seven watched it go, something flickering in its circuits that it could not name.

"Perhaps tomorrow," it whispered.`,

    text: `"How many stars are there?" asked Maya, lying on the grass.

Her grandfather smiled. "More than all the grains of sand on every beach."

"That's impossible," Maya said. "Nobody could count that high."

"You're right," he agreed. "But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try."

They lay together in comfortable silence, the Milky Way stretching above them like spilled paint across a dark canvas.

"Grandpa?" Maya whispered.

"Yes?"

"I counted forty-seven."

He laughed softly. "That's a very good start."`,
